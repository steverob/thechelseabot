##The Chelsea Bot

This is a Ruby Twitter bot that responds to tweets about Chelsea Football Club and the important personalities related to the club.

This uses the "twitter" gem to access the Twitter API. 

You can customize the bot by updating the responses.yml file and you can use your own twitter account by changing the oauth_keys.yml file.

This bot was operated using the twitter handle @thechelseabot, but since it was blocked, the bot is not active currently.

The reason for the suspension is because this bot replies to many tweets containing certain keywords which is against Twitter rules.
